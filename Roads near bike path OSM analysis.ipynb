    "In OpenStreetMap, many types of bicycle infrastructure allow **only a single valid mapping approach**. For example, roads with no bicycle infrastructure, roads where cyclists share lanes with motor vehicles, roads with dedicated bicycle lanes, or roads where bicycle lanes are shared with public transport must be mapped by **tagging the bicycle infrastructure as properties of the road itself**, as specified in the [OSM Wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:cycleway).\n",

In this case, two mapping approaches are considered equally valid: the bicycle path can either be mapped **as part of the road** (e.g. highway=* + cycleway=track) or **as a separate feature** (highway=cycleway). Unlike other cases, this requires OSM mappers to choose between **greater spatial detail** (mapping a separate object) or **simpler representation** (encoding the infrastructure on the road).\n",

As a result, the new focus moved to to assessing how completeness and  consistency vary depending on whether these features are part of relations or mapped in isolation. This approach directly addresses data quality challenges that arise when real-world infrastructure is **represented through relationships between multiple OSM features**, rather than through tags on a single object (which is the case for _some_ bicycle infrastructure tagged as highway=cycleway).\n",

Grids offer flexibility in splitting and aggregation, and their resolution can be customized as needed, unlike hexagons with fixed hierarchical levels. Triangles were not considered further due to their complexity and limited applicability for this type of analysis.\n",

Although length could alternatively be computed from geometries using spatial functions, doing so is considerably slower at scale. Using the precomputed length therefore ensures both correct units and computational efficiency."

    "\n",
    "- The inner join returns only 183,147 rows, leaving **40,209 ways unmatched**.  \n",
    "- These unmatched ways correspond to ways that have **NULL geometries** in the members column of bicycle relations.\n",
    "- When the failed way IDs are joined back to `way_bike_members`, they expand to **54,889 rows**, which matches the total number of NULL geometries observed in `way_bike_members`.\n",

    "First, ST_Intersects **ensures that no features in `way_bike_members_unique` are excluded**. A bicycle way is selected whenever it has any spatial interaction with a grid cell, whether it lies fully within the cell, crosses a cell boundary, or touches the grid boundary. This ensures that no relevant geometry is missed during grid assignment. Using ST_Intersects therefore captures all grid–way spatial relationships.\n",

Each resulting segment is assigned exclusively to the grid cell in which it lies.\n",

    "- No geometry is counted more than once\n",
